# Retrospective - Sprint 1

Group D

## Stories and tasks

### Stories and points

We committed to 4 stories: we implemented only 1 of them and we started working on other 2 stories.

|  | Total | Committed | Implemented | Work in progress |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stories | 30 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
| Points | 151 | 20* | 5 | 4 |

**Note**: not counting effort for learning

### Tasks and hours

The total number of tasks were 43.

|   |  Average  |
|---|---|
| Actual hours per task  | ?*  |
| Tasks per story | 10.75  |

|   |  Hours estimated  | Actual hours |
|---|---|---|
| Per task  | ?/43=  | ??/43= |
| Overall | ? | ?? |

The total task estimation error ratio, given by the division between actual and estimated time is: ??/?=

**Note**: for those statistics, we are taking into account also tasks implemented of the unfinished stories 

## Stories comparison

For this part of the retrospective, since we implemented only 1 stories completely, it's not possible to evaluate ratios among stories with different estimated points.

### Estimated time

| Story points | Average of estimated time(hours)
| --- | --- |
| 5 | ? |

**Ratio of averages**: NA

### Actual time

| Story points | Average of actual time(hours)
| --- | --- |
| 5 | 5.8 |

**Ratio of averages**: NA

### Considerations

We noticed that:

* Story #1, the one we implemented, was ???

## What caused errors in estimation

There were not big errors in story estimation. The principal estimation error was on the estimation of the learning effort: it was underestimated.

## Definition of Done

* _Unit test_: rails test
* _Code review_: at the end of each story (exploiting also pull requests)
* _Code on VCS_: (GitHub)
* _Performed E2E test_: ??

## Lessons learned

Positive:

* Having someone in the group who knows the technology and is available for answering questions saves a lot of time.

Negative:

* Trying to challenge ourselves in using 2 completely new technologies could be dangerous.
* If someone does not agree totally on team choices it is better to tell the others as soon as possible.
* If the infrastructure must be changed, it should be done as soon as possible during the sprint.

## Possible improvements

* Trying to work all together, at least at the beginning, in order to share knowledge
* Don't take for granted the individual capability of learning a lot of new things in a short time

## Proud of

* Backend infrastructure

* Database management system
