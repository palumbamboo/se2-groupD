# Retrospective - Sprint 1

Group D

## Stories and tasks

### Stories and points

We committed to 4 stories: we implemented only 1 of them and we started working on other 2 stories.

|  | Total | Committed | Implemented | Work in progress |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stories | 30 | 4 | 1 | 2 |
| Points | 151 | 20 | 5 | 4 |

**Note**: We are not counting effort for learning.

### Tasks and hours

The total number of tasks were 43.

|   |  Average  |
|---|---|
| Actual hours per task  | 0.56  |
| Tasks per story | 10.75  |

|   |  Hours estimated  | Actual hours |
|---|---|---|
| Per task  | 24.5/43=0.57  | 24/43=0.56 |
| Overall | 24.5 | 24 |

The total task estimation error ratio, given by the division between actual and estimated time is: 24/24.5=0.98.

**Note**: for those statistics, we are taking into account also implemented tasks of the unfinished stories.

## Stories comparison

For this part of the retrospective, since we completed only 1 stories, it's not possible to evaluate ratios among stories with different estimated points.

### Estimated time

| Story points | Average of estimated time(hours)
| --- | --- |
| 5 | 10.5 |

**Ratio of averages**: NA

### Actual time

| Story points | Average of actual time(hours)
| --- | --- |
| 5 | 12 |

**Ratio of averages**: NA

### Considerations

We noticed that:

* Estimation of story #1, the one we implemented, was quite correct. 

## What caused errors in estimation

There were not big errors in story estimation. The principal estimation error was on the estimation of the learning effort: it was underestimated.

## Definition of Done

* **Unit test**: rails test;
* **Code review**: at the end of each story (exploiting also pull requests);
* **Code on VCS**: git on GitHub;
* **Performed E2E test**: not done.

## Lessons learned

Positive:

* Having someone in the group who knows the technology and is available for answering questions saves a lot of time.

Negative:

* Trying to challenge ourselves in using 2 completely new technologies can be dangerous.
* If someone does not agree on team choices it is better to tell the others as soon as possible.
* If the infrastructure need to be changed, it should be done as soon as possible during the sprint.

## Possible improvements

* Trying to work all together, at least at the beginning, in order to share knowledge.
* Don't take for granted the individual capability of learning a lot of new things in a short time.

## Proud of

* Backend infrastructure: well structured and ready to support future stories.
